  - Behavioral patterns in communication.
  - Media content analysis.
  - Psychological evaluations.

  Applications:
  - Predicting actions of adversaries or leaders.
  - Crafting effective psychological operations (PSYOPS).
  - Countering propaganda campaigns.

### 11. Imagery Intelligence (IMINT)
Definition: Visual intelligence gathered from images, videos, and other visual sources.

  Sources:
  - Satellite imagery.
  - Drone footage.
  - Reconnaissance photography.

  Applications:
  - Identifying military installations or movements.
